<h1>Can you make an app for sharing pictures, something like a Instagram?</h1>

<h4>Beginner Programmer</h4>

The mobile app will be pretty easy, just need to use some native library to display list of pictures.

And for backend service we can use a Tomcat server for the REST APIs.

Will take a max effort of a month.

(Super confident)

<h4>Backend will require -</h4>

Something equivalent to Graph DB
Multiple micro-services
Security of apis
Pen testing
UTs, Functional test cases
Automated test cases
Auto scaling group
Administration module
Stats module
Cdns
CICD
GEO-LOCATION Compliances
And many more things..

The minimal viable product with minimal very very basic functionality will take atleast 3 months with a team of 6â€“7 good software engineers, an architect, a manager and a UX guy.

(Still thinking what major things are missing in the list)
