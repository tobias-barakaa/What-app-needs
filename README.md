<h1>Can you make an app for sharing pictures, something like a Instagram?</h1>

<h4>Beginner Programmer</h4>

The mobile app will be pretty easy, just need to use some native library to display list of pictures.

And for backend service we can use a Tomcat server for the REST APIs.

Will take a max effort of a month.

(Super confident)

<h6>Mobile app will need -</h6>

<h2>Authentication:</h2>
<p>Ensuring that users are who they claim to be before granting access to the application. Common methods include username/password, biometrics, or OAuth.</p>

<h2>Authorization:</h2>
<p>Determining what actions and resources a user is allowed to access or modify within the application. Authorization ensures that authenticated users have appropriate permissions.</p>

<h2>Caching:</h2>
<p>Storing frequently accessed data in a cache to reduce the need to fetch it from the original source repeatedly. This improves performance and reduces latency.</p>

<h2>Edge Cases:</h2>
<p>Considering and testing scenarios that are at the "edge" or boundary of expected input conditions. These are often situations that may not occur frequently but can have a significant impact when they do.</p>

<h2>Basic Functionality:</h2>
<p>Implementing the core features and functions that define the primary purpose of the application.</p>

<h2>Click Stream:</h2>
<p>Tracking and analyzing the sequence of user interactions within the application. Click stream analysis helps understand user behavior and optimize the user experience.</p>

<h2>Unit Test Cases:</h2>
<p>Writing and executing tests that validate the smallest units of code (functions, methods, or classes) to ensure they work as intended.</p>

<h2>Functional Test Cases:</h2>
<p>Testing the overall functionality of a specific feature or the entire system. Functional tests verify that the application behaves correctly according to specifications.</p>

<h2>Automated Test Cases:</h2>
<p>Creating scripts or automated tests that can be run to validate various aspects of the application's functionality. Automated testing helps catch regressions and ensures consistent behavior.</p>

<h2>Native Apps for Multiple Platforms:</h2>
<p>Developing separate versions of the application tailored for different operating systems (e.g., iOS and Android) using platform-specific development tools.</p>

<h2>Common Libraries:</h2>
<p>Utilizing shared code libraries or frameworks to streamline development, improve consistency, and leverage existing solutions for common tasks.</p>

<h2>Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD):</h2>
<p>Implementing practices and tools that automate the process of integrating code changes into a shared repository, running tests, and deploying the application to production. CI/CD helps maintain code quality and accelerate the delivery pipeline.</p>

<h2>Scalability and Performance Optimization:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Ensure the app can handle a large number of users and data efficiently.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Security Measures:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Encrypt sensitive data.</li>
  <li>Guard against common security threats (e.g., SQL injection, cross-site scripting).</li>
  <li>Regularly update and patch dependencies to address vulnerabilities.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Database Design and Optimization:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Choose an appropriate database system and design the schema efficiently.</li>
  <li>Optimize database queries for improved performance.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Error Handling and Logging:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Implement comprehensive error handling mechanisms.</li>
  <li>Set up logging to track and diagnose issues effectively.</li>
</ul>

<h2>User Feedback and Analytics:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Integrate feedback mechanisms for users.</li>
  <li>Implement analytics to gather insights on user behavior.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Internationalization and Localization:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Make the app adaptable for a global audience by supporting multiple languages and regions.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Offline Functionality:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Consider implementing features that work seamlessly in offline mode.</li>
  <li>Synchronize data once the device is back online.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Accessibility:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Ensure the app is accessible to users with disabilities.</li>
  <li>Comply with accessibility standards and guidelines.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Versioning and Rollback Strategy:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Establish a versioning strategy for both the app and APIs.</li>
  <li>Plan for a rollback strategy in case of unexpected issues.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Documentation:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Create comprehensive documentation for code, APIs, and system architecture.</li>
  <li>Include guidelines for onboarding new developers.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Community and Open Source Contributions:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Encourage and engage in open source contributions.</li>
  <li>Stay updated on industry best practices and emerging technologies.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Compliance and Regulations:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Ensure the app complies with relevant data protection and privacy regulations.</li>
  <li>Stay informed about legal requirements and industry standards.</li>
</ul>

<h2>User Experience (UX) and User Interface (UI) Design:</h2>
<ul>
